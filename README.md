# crm

This CRM system enhances efficiency in customer relationship management by allowing admins to manage sites and categorize employees into roles such as Manager, Worker, Helper, and Supervisor. Managers can record attendance using facial recognition and upload daily work photos. Built with React for the admin panel, Flutter for the manager module, and a Node.js backend with Python for face detection, this system ensures seamless operations and real-time data access.
